## How It Works

### 1. MCP Server Layer (`mcp-server.js`)

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as a bridge between Claude Code and the Go trading backend:

```
Claude Code <---> MCP Server (Node.js) <---> Go Backend <---> Alpaca API
```

- Exposes 40+ trading tools to Claude Code
- Handles request/response formatting
- Manages authentication and rate limiting
- Runs on port 4534 by default

### 2. Go Backend (`cmd/bot/main.go`)

The trading bot backend handles:
- **Order Execution** - PlaceOrder, CancelOrder via Alpaca API
- **Market Data** - Real-time quotes, historical bars, options chains
- **Position Management** - Automated stop-loss/take-profit monitoring
- **News Aggregation** - Google News + MarketWatch feeds
- **AI Integration** - Gemini for news cleaning/summarization
- **Activity Logging** - Trade journals and decision logs

### 3. Services Architecture

| Service | Purpose | Key Functions |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `AlpacaTradingService` | Order execution | PlaceOrder, CancelOrder, GetPositions |
| `AlpacaDataService` | Market data | GetHistoricalBars, GetLatestQuote |
| `AlpacaOptionsDataService` | Options data | GetOptionChain, GetOptionSnapshot |
| `PositionManager` | Automation | MonitorPositions, CloseManagedPosition |
| `StockAnalysisService` | Analysis | AnalyzeStock, GetTechnicalAnalysis |
| `NewsService` | Intelligence | GetCleanedNews, AggregateNews |
| `GeminiService` | AI processing | CleanNewsForTrading |
| `ActivityLogger` | Journaling | LogDecision, LogActivity |

### 4. Data Flow

```
1. User Request (Claude Code)
   ↓
2. MCP Tool Call (e.g., place_options_order)
   ↓
3. HTTP Request to Go Backend
   ↓
4. Controller (OrderController.PlaceOptionsOrder)
   ↓
5. Service (AlpacaTradingService.PlaceOrder)
   ↓
6. Alpaca API (live/paper trading)
   ↓
7. Response back through chain
   ↓
8. Result displayed in Claude Code
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create `.env` file:
```bash
ALPACA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALPACA_ENDPOINT= # Start with paper trading
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key  # For AI news cleaning

```

### 2. Build & Run Go Backend

```bash
# Build the bot
go build -o prophet_bot ./cmd/bot

# Run the bot
./prophet_bot
```

### 3. Start MCP Server

The MCP server runs automatically when Claude Code starts via `.mcp.json` configuration.

### 4. Start Trading

Open Claude Code and use MCP tools:
```
get_account           # Check portfolio status
get_options_positions # Review open positions
get_quick_market_intelligence  # Get market news
analyze_stocks        # Technical analysis
place_options_order   # Execute trades
```

## AI News Intelligence (Gemini)

The system uses Google Gemini to transform raw news feeds into actionable trading intelligence.

### What It Does

- **Cleans noisy RSS feeds** into structured summaries
- **Extracts key themes** and sentiment by sector
- **Identifies trading-relevant catalysts** (earnings, FDA decisions, macro events)
- **Reduces token usage by 80-90%** compared to raw news

### Tools That Use It

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_quick_market_intelligence` | Fast 15-article MarketWatch summary |
| `get_cleaned_news` | Multi-source aggregated intelligence |
| `analyze_stocks` | Includes news context per ticker |
| `aggregate_and_summarize_news` | Custom topic/symbol aggregation |

### Example Output

Raw news: 50+ noisy articles with ads, duplicates, irrelevant content

Cleaned output:
```json
{
  "summary": "Tech rallying on NVDA earnings beat...",
  "key_themes": ["AI infrastructure spending", "Fed pause expectations"],
  "sentiment_by_sector": {"technology": "bullish", "energy": "neutral"},
  "actionable_tickers": ["NVDA", "AMD", "SMCI"]
}
```

### Configuration

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

**Optional:** If no key is set, intelligence tools return raw news instead of AI-cleaned summaries.

## Trading Strategy

### Core Approach: Multi-Timeframe Options Trading

The system trades **both directions** (calls AND puts) based on market conditions. Not married to bullish or bearish - if the market dumps, buy puts; if it bounces, flip to calls.

**1. LEAPS Foundation (60-90+ DTE)**
- Hold longer-dated calls on high-conviction names (tech, broad market ETFs)
- These ride broader trends and survive short-term volatility
- Provides baseline exposure while scalps generate active returns

**2. Intraday Scalping (0-5 DTE)**
- Trade both directions based on momentum
- Quick entries, quick exits, tight stops
- Capture overnight gaps and intraday swings

**3. Active Hedging**
- Hold protective puts against bullish exposure
- When market sells off, hedges cushion losses
- Provides flexibility to wait for bounce opportunities

**4. Disciplined Exits**
- Take profits aggressively on winners (+25-50%)
- Cut losers fast (-15% or thesis break)
- Never average down without regime confirmation

**5. Capital Preservation Mode**
- Maintain 50-70% cash at all times
- Scale down when volatility spikes or market gets choppy
- Fed weeks / major events = smaller positions, more hedges

### Risk Management

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Max position size | 15% of portfolio |
| Max total deployment | 50% of portfolio |
| Stop loss | -15% or thesis break |
| Daily loss limit | -5% triggers halt |
| Cash reserve | 50-70% at all times |

---

## Vector Search (AI Memory)

The system includes semantic search for finding similar historical trades:

### How It Works

1. Trade decisions in `decisive_actions/` are embedded using local AI model
2. 384-dimensional vectors stored in SQLite (`data/prophet_trader.db`)
3. AI queries past trades using natural language

### Example Queries

```javascript
// Find similar SPY scalp setups
find_similar_setups("SPY gap up scalp for quick profit")

// Find similar stop-loss decisions
find_similar_setups("cut loss fast to preserve capital")

// Find profit-taking patterns
find_similar_setups("take profit on winning position")
```

### Benefits

- AI learns from experience
- Pattern recognition across different wording
- Local model (no API costs)
- Automatic updates via `store_trade_setup`

### Seeding Your Own Knowledge

You can pre-populate the vector database with your own trading principles or example trades. Create a JSON file with entries like:

```json
[
  {
    "symbol": "GENERAL",
    "action": "KNOWLEDGE",
    "strategy": "RISK_MANAGEMENT",
    "reasoning": "Risk 1-2% of capital per trade maximum. Position sizing is more important than entry price.",
    "market_context": "Survive to trade another day."
  },
  {
    "symbol": "NVDA",
    "action": "BUY",
    "strategy": "SWING",
    "result_pct": 42.3,
    "result_dollars": 3180,
    "reasoning": "Bought 30-45 DTE calls with delta 0.35 on pullback to VWAP after earnings beat.",
    "market_context": "Tech sector leading, VIX at 14, AI narrative strengthening."
  }
]
```

Then use the `store_trade_setup` MCP tool to load each entry, or create a simple script to batch import them.

### Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
1. Monitor for setups (breakouts, pullbacks, momentum)
2. Execute trades with limit orders: `place_options_order`
3. Log decisions: `log_decision`
4. Manage positions: Use `wait` tool to check in time blocks
5. Cut losers at -15%, take profits at +25-50%

### End of Day (3:50 PM ET)
1. `get_options_positions` - Review all positions
2. Close <3 DTE scalps before close
3. Decide: Hold overnight or close swings?
4. `log_activity` - Log daily activity

### Weekly Review

## Key Functions (High Complexity)

| Function | Complexity | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `CloseManagedPosition` | 15 | Close position with cleanup |
| `LogPositionClosed` | 8 | Log trade with P&L calculation |

---

## Development

### Adding New MCP Tools

1. Add endpoint in Go backend (`controllers/`)
2. Add route in `setupRouter()` (`cmd/bot/main.go`)
3. Add tool handler in `mcp-server.js`
4. Test with Claude Code

---

## Production Considerations

### Risk Management
- Always use **limit orders** (never market orders on options)
- Start with **paper trading** (`ALPACA_PAPER=true`)
- Test rules thoroughly before live capital
- Monitor **transaction costs** (<5% of gross profit)

### Monitoring
- Use the `wait` tool to let the AI check positions in time blocks
- Review `decisive_actions/` daily
- Weekly review `activity_logs/`
- Track win rate and profit factor monthly

### Governance
- Rules are guidelines, not hard constraints
- Update rules based on results, not aspirations
- Agents are advisory, not required
- Success = profitable trading
